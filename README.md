Greetings everyone, firstly I wish to clarify something, I will be making this in three parts. 

Part 1, the responce to his claims towards myself and working as a Moderator and Dispute Resolver.
Part 2, the responce/apology I owe Callum.
Part 3, Two Questions I asked Badplye.

## Part 1

----

For those who aren't aware, Mine-List is a upcoming marketplace owned and operated by Julius, Aiden, Badplye. I was brought onto the Staff team threw recommendations, I did apply as well however I was denied simply due to the staff team being full at the time, however some staff members have left for reasons I can not disclose but I can say they left peacefully.

I want to talk about this video's description. 
"Don't join any of his servers, he will keep your information and use it maliciously. He will always be a toxic person with his empty threats, I wouldn't waste your time with him." - Callum.

##### I will break this down and respond to ever part of this.


- "Don't join any of his servers, he will keep your information and use it maliciously."
Firstly, if you are uninformed I currently do not own any servers. I sold WrathHQ to a private party for a undisclosed amount, for the respect of those users whom bought it they will remain unknown, in terms of the second piece of this. "he will keep your information and use it maliciously." Keep your Information and use it Maliciously? that is utterly false, and let me clarify. I have never once used any private information in any form that could be considered malicious, I have seen doxes before who hasn't. I've seen information of countless people. every server owner does, I mean a user's IP Address is just simply to identify them and to insure they aren't evading a punishment. however I will agree with Callum in terms of Information being used malicious not in this case but some server owners and people sadly gather information and leak it to the public for a few reasons. 1. Tarnish a server's reputation 2. Tarnish the Owner's Reputation 3. Make the server die. and in this case against myself. I never once commit such acts, sadly however my previous servers in the past (NightmareHCF, RiverMC) have been accessed by third parties a few times leaking user information because people honestly disliked myself at that time and caused it to happen. admittedly it was my fault for the Leaks happening because back then I knew just about nothing in prevention of brute forcing and other methods to remotely gain access to the backend system. If I were to ever return to server owning I will insure security above all else. and with callum's claims about me using information maliciously that's honestly false simply due to the fact I can't afford a botnet, booter and other things. in the past I have threatened users and I honestly feel bad about it but EVERYONE has had a history in this community their actions differ from another however I'm just trying to state no one is perfect people make mistakes and learn from them and move on. I believe I have done just that, and with Callum trying to tarnish my reputation into getting me fired from Mine-List is just laughable.


- "He will always be a toxic person with his empty threats."
Toxicity is something that isn't easy to fix, and quite honestly I have my moments however I have improved as a person and generally now I'm just a guy trying to do my best, in the past I have had a history of making threatening messages to people implying I was going to send a team of armored police to their home (Swatting) or send their modem a lot of data in a quick manner to slow down their internet (DDoSing) and quite honestly I admit this is was my past and it is something I regret doing doing all together, I can't change the past however I can only change what I do the next time. knowing this now, I feel my past experience has provided me with what is the right option and what I should do next time and honestly I'm glad I made that mistaken back then because now I know what to do moving forward.


- "I wouldn't waste your time with him."
I believe Callum states this as he believes i'm utterly a "Lost cause" and I'm just a "Skid / Clown"(Meaning that I'm utterly a fool, and a joke) and my response is that people change overtime if we never made mistakes the world wouldn't be how it is today and if we were always perfect then that would take away apart of being human.

##### Now I wish to shortly respond to the video with what I feel about is most important to respond to.

- "Toxicity Claims" - http://prntscr.com/oss5tb
as you can see I was on my alt account "WhyuTryin" just being toxic on FadeCloud some skyblock server, I was being toxic and spamming stuff like that quite honestly because I was simply bored at the time and I found that community's reaction to something like pornhub in chat funny.

- "Shot him" - http://prntscr.com/oss6n7
Quite honestly if you can't tell Callum is British and lives in the united kingdom, I'm not going to pay a sum of money to fly across the ocean to shot a guy with a shotgun it was clearly just me being toxic and stupid. death threats and anything of the sort are not a joke and please don't do what I did here. | PSA

there is more proof against myself however I don't feel I need to respond to every single claim as they are similar. Toxicity, harmless threatening, utter wankery, etc.

## Part 2

----

Firstly I wish to say I'm sorry to you Callum for offending you regards to your private matters, I will not disclose or re-state what I've said however I admit I was wrong in that regardless of what I state, I do honestly wish you the best of luck with your future in computer science and other future interests of yourself, I understand I offended you and I honestly am gratefully sorry. I have truly cleared my block list. the reason I have kept you blocked is simply due to me being aware that you would do your hardest to tarnish my creditability via my tweets by replying to them with the video(s) you have made and other proof of yours. 
I honestly wish for peace between us moving forward, I have no intention of bothering you nor contacting you unless you wish to speak with me.
